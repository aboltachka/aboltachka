# Hi there! <span class="wave">ðŸ‘‹</span>
## About me

ðŸŽ“ I am Anton Boltachka, a reseacher.

ðŸŒ± I am a big fan of researchers who artfully create fantastic methodologies to find solutions to complex problems.

ðŸ“– I am constantly pushing myself to try something new. My hobbies include **chess, hiking, jogging, cooking, video games**, etc. Being lucky to know **Belarusian, Russian, English, and Ukrainian languages**, I plan to start learning **Spanish**.

ðŸš€ I love mixing education from different countries and regions. I feel much more comfortable studying and working within multicultural settings. To date, I have studied in three countries: **Belarus, the United Kingdom, and the United States**.
