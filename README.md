## Hi there!

### About me

ðŸŽ“ I am Anton Boltachka, an American University **MA in Applied Economics** graduate (class 2021) with experience assisting and managing research projects in think tanks, a central bank, and an international organization.

ðŸ”­  I am currently searching for a Ph.D. program in Economics to continue my education and keep up working on a couple of research in the field of **Development Economics, Microeconomics, and Political Economy** of Post-Soviet countries. I am planning to publish ongoing and future research projects here.

ðŸŒ±  I am a big fan of researchers who artfully created fantastic methodologies using non-standard data to find solutions to complex problems. That is why my current phase of research cemented my desire to advance **skills in analyzing economic issues with tools from economics, data science, and other related fields**. 

ðŸ“– I am constantly pushing myself to try something new. My hobbies include **chess, hiking, jogging, cooking, video games**, etc. Being lucky to know **Belarusian, Russian, English, and Ukrainian languages**, I plan to start learning **Spanish** (Since I love watching La Liga football games, I'd like to understand more when players give interviews after a match).

ðŸš€ I love mixing education from different countries and regions. I feel much more comfortable studying and working within multicultural settings. To date, I have studied in three countries: **Belarus, the United Kingdom, and the United States**.
